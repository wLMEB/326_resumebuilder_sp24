            <p><i>Resume_builder</i> is a web application that targets a faster and more efficient way of resume building. Our project aims to help college students and recent graduates have a smoother experience through their job application phase. With Resume_builder, users can input all of their past experiences by categories, including skills, work experience, project experience, etc., into our <i>experience bank</i>. All information entered will be stored in a database by category at the back end so that there will be no need to re-enter the same information twice. There are also options to edit information that has already been input into the <i>experience bank</i> in the case of updating information. When it's time to generate a new resume for a role or company, users will be able to select the skills and experiences they wish to include in their resume, select a template format, and click a generation button. A copy of the resume will be properly formatted and ready to download.</p>

            <p>Resume builder: A web application that helps users quickly generate multiple resumes that meet different requirements, providing a variety of templates for users to choose from, helping users easily and conveniently generate different resumes for use in different scenarios. Job seekers often need to submit resumes to multiple companies, and different companies have different requirements for skills and experience, and the things they value are different. There is a lot of time-wasting repetitive work in the process of creating multiple resumes with different needs, such as copying information and reformatting. Our app hopes to help job seekers reduce this repetitive work and create multiple resumes with ease. At the same time, our templates make it easy for first-time resume makers to create a good-looking resume. Especially for users who are not good at typesetting, it can make them avoid the work they are not good at. Users only need to enter their various aspects of data with classification into the application, select specific templates and required data categories to easily generate resumes. Users can easily add, decrease, and change their own data for the data they have already entered. After the user completes the resume design, they can download the designed resume to the local computer.</p>
