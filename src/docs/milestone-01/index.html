            <p><i>Resume_builder</i> is a web application that targets a faster and more efficient way of resume building. Our project aims to help college students and recent graduates have a smoother experience through their job application phase. With Resume_builder, users can input all of their past experiences by categories, including skills, work experience, project experience, etc., into our <i>experience bank</i>. All information entered will be stored in a database by category at the back end so that there will be no need to re-enter the same information twice. There are also options to edit information that has already been input into the <i>experience bank</i> in the case of updating information. When it's time to generate a new resume for a role or company, users will be able to select the skills and experiences they wish to include in their resume, select a template format, and click a generation button. A copy of the resume will be properly formatted and ready to download.</p>
