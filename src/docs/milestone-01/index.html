            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><i>Resume_builder</i> is a web application that targets a faster and more efficient way of resume building. Our project aims to help college students and recent graduates have a smoother experience through their job application phase. With Resume_builder, users can input all of their past experiences by categories, including skills, work experience, project experience, etc., into our <i>experience bank</i>. All information entered will be stored in a database by category at the back end so that there will be no need to re-enter the same information twice. There are also options to edit information that has already been input into the <i>experience bank</i> in the case of updating information. When it's time to generate a new resume for a role or company, users will be able to select the skills and experiences they wish to include in their resume, select a template format, and click a generation button. A copy of the resume will be properly formatted and ready to download.</p>

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>For our Resume Builder to function as intended, we need to consider certain data requirements that need to be incorporated in order to capture and manage user input. Personal information such as name, contact information, residential address, LinkedIn, and personal website links need to be collected in order to format the desired resume. Following this data, users need to be able to enter their education and work experience. These fields include the name of the user’s educational institution and company, dates of employment and duration of education, and location. Specific to education, the user’s degree, major/field of study, and graduation date are requirements and for work experience, the job title and job description/responsibilities should be incorporated. Additional information that should be collected are projects created and skills acquired from work and education experiences, certifications and achievements, relevant coursework, and proficiency in languages. All of this data will be stored in databases based on categories and user’s will then be able to select specific pieces of information based on what type of resume they need to create for specific roles. Users will be able to change and add additional information if required and the data will be stored in the designated databases based on categories.</p>

        <section id="wire-frames">
            <h2>Wire Frames </h2>
            <p>To make our Resume Builder an easy experience for our users, it’s essential that we have components that make it easier for users to visualize the flow of the app and that they understand how to use it. To enable this, our app will include specific pages that will allow users to add their information in steps. The first page will be a landing page that gives users an introduction and some information about how to use the app and options to create a new resume or access a pre-existing one. This page will have labeled buttons that will inform users how to make a new resume or choose an already created one. Once the landing page is accessed, a new page will be displayed where users can input their personal information, work and education information, projects and experiences, and skills. Following this page, a preview page will be displayed where users can see how their final resume will look. There will also be options where users can make any changes or updates to their resume before generating the finalized document. The final page will show the generated resume with options to print or download the document to the local computer.</p>

            <h2> Real-World Connection</h2>
            <p>Resume builder: A web application that helps users quickly generate multiple resumes that meet different requirements, providing a variety of templates for users to choose from, helping users easily and conveniently generate different resumes for use in different scenarios. Job seekers often need to submit resumes to multiple companies, and different companies have different requirements for skills and experience, and the things they value are different. There is a lot of time-wasting repetitive work in the process of creating multiple resumes with different needs, such as copying information and reformatting. Our app hopes to help job seekers reduce this repetitive work and create multiple resumes with ease. At the same time, our templates make it easy for first-time resume makers to create a good-looking resume. Especially for users who are not good at typesetting, it can make them avoid the work they are not good at. Users only need to enter their various aspects of data with classification into the application, select specific templates and required data categories to easily generate resumes. Users can easily add, decrease, and change their own data for the data they have already entered. After the user completes the resume design, they can download the designed resume to the local computer.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Experience </h2>
            <p>In this project, we chose the direction of the project based on our own experience and deeply thinking about the needs of a group of people we are familiar with, that is, the needs of graduating students and job seekers. That's why we chose to create an app that can help clients quickly create multiple customized resumes. Based on our experience, we have an accurate and in-depth understanding of what the outcome of the project will be, and it will be a practical project rather than an unrealistic one. As a carrier, we chose to make it into a web application, which allows us to use the web programming knowledge learned in the course cs326 Web Programming in a structured way. At the same time, we can also widely apply and understand the knowledge and skills brought to us by other courses in this project, such as algorithm basics, programming basics, and human-computer interaction. There are four of us working as a team to complete this project, and in the process we will collaborate with each other and build the project with different thinking, knowledge and skills. In the process, our ability to work as a team will be enhanced. All in all, the project was able to meet the integrative experience requirements. In the realization of this project, we will integrate the learning and experience we have gained in general education and our professional skills in a structured environment. And practice general education learning objectives at a higher level, such as verbal communication and collaboration. And this project allows us to apply our knowledge to real-world problems.</p>
